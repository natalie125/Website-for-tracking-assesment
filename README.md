The project is a web-based application designed for managing assessments, allowing users to create, view, and track the status of assessments.
The application is structured with several key features and templates:

All Assessments: Displays a list of all assessments, detailing the title, deadline, module code, and status (completed or uncompleted)​(AllAssessments).

Create Assessment: Provides a form to input information for a new assessment, including title, deadline, module code, and a brief introduction​(CreateAssessment).

Completed Assessments: Lists assessments marked as completed, with details similar to those on the main page​(CompletedAssessments).

Uncompleted Assessments: Shows uncompleted assessments with an option to mark them as completed, updating the list dynamically​(UncompletedAssessments).

The project uses a base HTML template (base.html) that defines a common navigation structure for easy access to these pages, making the application straightforward and user-friendly​(base). This setup is ideal for keeping track of assessments, their deadlines, and statuses within a structured system.
